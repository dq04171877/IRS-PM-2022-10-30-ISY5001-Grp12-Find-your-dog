He plays with the other dogs and eats well - not picky and he waits patiently for his turn at meals.\n","Name:  Saint Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: Saint is a sweet dog but he was not brought up correctly in a number of ways by his previously family. Those were important foundation first steps and this will take time, patience, love and training to bring the best out of Saint.  \n","Name:  Dodie Jr Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: Dodie is a gentle dog. Always giving in to other dogs. He will need a family who is loving and patient to show him that there is no need to fend for himself anymore because he wont be left alone.\n","Name:  Zane Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: Zane is very good with children. However, when he was 1.5 yr old the 3rd child came about. Since then, he wasn't walked regularly and became unsocialized. Accordingly to ex owners, he disliked small white dogs and excitable dogs.\n","Name:  Aki Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: As the puppies are still growing up, we cannot say much about their personality yet.\n","Name:  Kaishin Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: As the puppies are still growing up, we cannot say much about their personality yet.\n","Name:  Kibo Sir Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Kibo is a very sweet boy with a cute short tail which wiggles when he is happy to see us in the morning. He is food motivated and gets along well with the rest of the pack. He is also very caring in the sense whereby although he was a newbie in the shelter, he took under his care another new younger dog (Miyoo) who was rescued few days later. Somehow Miyoo kept following him around he is her big brother.\n","Name:  Jay Jay Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Jay Jay has a pleasant personality. A sweet boy with no character issues at all. However he is very afraid of thunders and lightning. Therefore any adopter must be ready to provide him a safe corner such as a covered table or dog house to hide away when it happens.\n","Name:  Mateo Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Mateo took a while to trust us. He was very cautious of us initially perhaps because he was trapped, neutered and released under the TNRM program about a year ago. Sometimes experiences like this can be traumatic for the dog because they cannot understand why they were caught, put to a deep sleep, operated on and then wake up in an unfamiliar place and after a few days, being released back again. Nonetheless, Mateo started to understand that we meant him no harm as he observes how other dogs in the shelter respond to us in love and vice versa.\n","Name:  Jalen Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Jalen is a very easy dog to manage in terms of personality.

We were able to touch and pat him freely the following day after we rescued him on Wednesday night. Usually we will be more careful with newly rescued dogs but Noble is totally cool with humans approaching and touching him. Noble is 11 years old and he is limping on the right side of his hind leg. We are giving him rosehip and therapy to build up the strength of the leg again. But we really hope that God will move the heart of a family to take him and care and love him for the remaining years of his life. It could be 4-7 years but it is still a long time and we hope he doesnt need to stay in the shelter forever.\n","Name:  Nino Sir Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Nino Sir seems to not have been touched by humans before. His usual feeder said that he will come forward to eat but will never allow to be touched. Will retreat. When we first touched him in the shelter he was a little unsure but within 10 min he allowed us to clean his face. He has skin problem but in no time, he will be handsome again. You will see it in his photos and hopefully you will be the next person whom God prompt to adopt him and give him a better life.\n","Name:  Ardon Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: He is shy but friendly.\n","Name:  Lashon Blessing\n","Gender:  Male\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Lashon is a calm and good natured boy.

Usuallly new rescues need an average of a week or two to settle into the shelter. But Easter settled in almost immediately and by the 3rd day we decided to walk him.

We were told them as a stray dog, the feeders fed unhealthy stuff like duck necks so her taste buds needed to be tuned back to a healty diet\n","Name:  Marvel Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Marvel is a greedy dog so an easy eater. She is also a sweet dog and we gained her trust by letting her observe how we treat other dogs in the shelter before engaging her more personally. Most of the time dogs who are captured will have a negative impression of humans so we needed her to understand we are not the same as the ones who caught her. Slowly she became more and more comfortable and started sleeping on the dog beds next to the other dogs at night.\n","Name:  Psalmus Jr Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Unknown till 7 months\n","Personality: Psalmus is a very sociable puppy with both humans and dogs. She adapts very easily and is very intelligent. She knows when to retreat when she knows she is pushing her luck with the adult dogs and she knows when to be a little bit more naughty when the humans are around to protect her.\n","Name:  Lily & Lila (Siblings)\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: Both playful and loving, they have slightly different personalities:\n","Name:  Kara Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: As the puppies are still growing up, we cannot say much about their personality yet.\n","Name:  Hikari Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: As the puppies are still growing up, we cannot say much about their personality yet.\n","Name:  Miyoo Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Miyoo is shy but sweet. She is beautiful and has a pleasant character in the sense whereby although she deals with new faces of volunteers on a daily basis, she allows us to sit side by side with her, touch her paws, apply medicine, hand feed her and stroke her. Another wonderful dog in the making.\n","Name:  Izzie Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Izzie was initially afraid of human touch but by the end of the first week with us, all her uncertainty has disappeared. She was fearless, playing with and eating among the adults and she was also freely walking around us. She started to approach and sniff us and before we know it, she is all friendly with us. She will make a good and confident dog in the hands of a good owner. \n","Name:  Hailey Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Hailey settled down in the shelter pretty quickly. She is a sweet girl even when she had her first bath, blood test and vaccination. She has a pair of big eyes and big standing ears. She loves to eat. \n","Name:  Malia Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Malia is a very curious dog with a desire to get to know people. She doesn't seem to regard humans as dangerous, perhaps because she was fed by people living in the HDB vicinity. She loves to eat and started playing with some dogs within a week in the shelter.\n","Name:  Misha Jr Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Misha open up pretty fast. She started to approach us for food in less than a week and loves to drink milk. She was also ok to be touched and bathed. A sweet gal in the making.\n","Name:  Naomi Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: First impression of Noami was that she is timid and skittish. But after letting her settle down at shelter for 2 weeks, we saw her open up, walking around and trying to play with other dogs. She may look abit worn out physically because obviously she did not have a smooth life out there as a stray from the looks of her injury scars. We really hope a special family will come forward and see her beyond the scars and at least attempt to give her a good life in a home. She is curious about humans and is coming forward to smell us from behind or at our hands. Life is meaningful when you can help others. May you hear a tug in your heart to help Noami.\n","Name:  Mercy Jr Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Mercy is a very sweet gal. She is quite small sized. She came in a badly matted furcoat condition. Because she was mild and gentle, we managed to shave her on the 1st day of arrival and then bathed her on the 3rd day. From the look of the injury around her muzzle and inside her mouth (both side of the gum suffered lacerations), it is possible that Mercy had something tied around her mouth. She was rescued near Nature Farm along Lorong Pasu where we rescued Gideon who also had a rope bound around his waist. It makes us wonder if there is some abuse going on with the homeless dogs around there because it is 2 cases in 6 months.\n","Name:  Tasha Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Personality is still in development stage but suffice to say all are cute and smart and used to humans presence. To adopt a puppy so young, how he or she will eventually turn out to be in terms of personality and conduct is 99% determined by upbringing of the family who adopt her or him. Mold them well in the right way if u want them to become good dogs. \n","Name:  Tammie Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Tammie, Sammie and Ellie are a little timid upon rescue because we found out a month after we rescued them that they had been taken for sterilization and then dump back to the wild. This is not a good first connection with humans which they should experience at such young age. It took us a month before they opening up. Ellie was the tiniest and most malnutritioned but she opened up the fastest and Tammie the last. But all three are not negative in their reactions or responses in any way including during baths, they are just still in the state whereby they are not sure what humans will do to them \"again\" if they end up in their hands again. \n","Name:  Olive Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Outgoing and fearless personality. Gel herself into the shelter pack on the night she was rescued and slept among them so comfortably. Intelligent.

She is calm and walks well. Gets along well with other dogs too. A little shy toward humans as she is newly rescued.\n","Name:  Summer Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Loves to play like any young dog. Popular among the dogs perhaps because she is both fun-loving and tolerant. However she is still shy when meeting new faces and will go hide. \n","Name:  Haven Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: She is fearful of other dogs for a start because she had no social interaction with other dogs till she met us. She can be protective of her food, probably because she has been starved for a long time. \n","Name:  Miracle Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: \n","Personality: Miracle is so-called because her existence is indeed a miraculous happening. Before she was captured by AVA, there was once when she was knocked by a car on her hind leg and started limping. Very soon she disappeared for a long 3 weeks. When she reappeared, she was emaciated. We thought she is going to die but she survived and she did well. Even that limping hind leg was completely restored and you will not see any abnormality in her walking at all. Her life is a miracle.\n","Name:  Chosen Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Sweet toward human. Food motivated.

She greets you enthusiastically with jumps. Some people like it while other hate it, so it is really dependent on what type of dog’s character you are looking for. Most of the time, she walks well on leash and does not pull. She also listens when scolded and she only does her business during walks.\n","Name:  Sheeba Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: Yes\n","Personality: Sheeba is a very sweet girl despite having a harsh life as a stray before rescue. The veterinarian suspected that the left eye was already blinded as a puppy when she was plagued with a sickness. Although she survived and overcame the sickness, this left eye is beyond repair - blind but not causing her any pain or discomfort. Even with a limited vision as compared with the average dog, she is a smart dog - probably this is how she survived for 2 years out there. She learned how to pee on fake grass in the shelter on her own; if she does it on newspaper, she will cover it up cleanly. And she is a splendid mummy who fed all 11 puppies well thereby enabling them to grow up healthily.  \n","Name:  Dorcas\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: \n","Personality: Affectionate, playful, inquisitive, teachable \n","Name:  Keeper Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: Keeper is very sweet with humans but selective toward dogs.

They like to groom her by licking her all over the face and she is tolerant of that or maybe she enjoys the attention! She has a set of beautiful eyes.\n","\n","Like the german shepherds, she whines or talks alot in sounds of whines. \n","Name:  Mercy Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: Mercy hops like a rabbit. She gets happy and relaxed when she goes out for walks or car rides or outings. But when she returns home, she wil always go back to one same spot and cuddles herself in one corner most of the time. Loves to roll on the grass and enjoys swimming too.\n","Name:  Ella Blessing\n","Gender:  Female\n","hdbapprove: No\n","Personality: Ella is shy and slower to warming up but she is also as intelligent - learning tricks. This is a dog of hidden treasure who sits back to observe and learn. Given a good and consistent owner, a beautiful personality will surface out in no time.\n"]}]}]}
